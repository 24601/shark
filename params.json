{"name":"Shark","body":"### Shark\r\nWe have ported Apache Hive, the large-scale Hadoop data warehouse solution, to run queries on Spark. The resulting system, Shark (Hive on Spark), can answer Hive QL queries 30 times faster than Hive without modification to the existing data. It is backward-compatible with the Hive QL language, metastore, and user-defined functions. We will cover the architecture and implementation of Shark, including our additions to Hive QL that allow users to cache data in memory, and a new column-oriented format we have designed for storing Hive data efficiently in memory on the JVM as arrays of primitive types.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we are working on integrating SQL processing with machine learning, which we see as a natural future direction for Shark due to Spark's inherent efficiency at iterative algorithms. In Shark, we allow users to express their machine learning algorithms as Scala-based \"distributed UDFs\", which then run in the same execution engine as the SQL query processor. This enables much more efficient data pipelines, and provides a unified system for data analysis using both SQL and sophisticated statistical learning functions.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nBLah blah blah blah.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* [Shark's SIGMOD 2012 demo submission](http://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/publication/shark-fast-data-analysis-using-coarse-grained-distributed-memory-demonstration-paper/)\r\n* [Getting Started with Apache Hive](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted)\r\n* [Spark Project](http://www.spark-project.org/)\r\n* [Apache Mesos](http://incubator.apache.org/mesos/)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nShark is developed in the [UC Berkeley AMP Lab](http://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/) by Cliff Engle, Antonio Lupher, and [Reynold Xin](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rxin).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWe are looking for users (ideally with existing Hive warehouses) to try out Shark and help us improve it.
