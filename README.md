# Shark (Hive on Spark)

Shark is a large-scale data warehouse system for Spark designed to be compatible with
Apache Hive. It can answer Hive QL queries up to 100 times faster than Hive without
modification to the existing data nor queries. Shark supports Hive's query language,
metastore, serialization formats, and user-defined functions.

Shark 0.3 requires Scala 2.9.2, Hive 0.9, and Spark 0.7.

Please do NOT use the 0.3 branch. This was built only as a transient branch during a backend refactoring.
